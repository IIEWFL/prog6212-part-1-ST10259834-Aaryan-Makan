# 💼 Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)

A simple **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} web app** that helps Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers **submit monthly claims** and lets programme coordinators and academic managers **review and approve them**.

> ⚠️ This version is only a **visual prototype** — it shows the layout and navigation flow. Functionality (saving data, tracking statuses, etc.) will be added in later parts of the project.
